# MATERIAL EXTRACTER SCRIPT

Welcome to the readme file of this script

This script is written using python so you will have to install python on your computer first, any version greater or equal to **python** **3.8** will work.

The material management system is currently working with firebase, this script will connect to the specific firebase project, in order to be able to do that, you will have to get the `serviceAccountKey.json` from the person responsible for this.

Once you get the file place it under the "cred" folder so your file directory will be like this :

```
| + src/
  | - app.py

| + cred/
  | - serviceAccountKey.json

| - .gitignore
| - main.py
| - README.md
| - requirements.txt
| - install.cmd
| - run.cmd
```

if this is your first time running this script on your computer, you will need first to run the `install.cmd` file by just clicking twice.

if you need to do the extract just run the `run.cmd` file.

Tara ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ you will have your `extract.csv` and `extract.xlsx` file that you can just open with Excel
